\format{
"mpm.rfc" is a list of 5 objects:
\enumerate{
\item "training", a list of 5 data.frames (T1-5) corresponding to the 
   5 RFC training sets;
\item "validation", a list of 5 data.frames (V1-5) corresponding to the 
   5 RFC validation sets;
\item "rfc", a list of 5 \code{randomForest} objects, corresponding to 
   the 5 classifiers of the ensemble;
\item "ranking", a data.frame reporting MDA and MDG values, as well as 
   their minmax-normalized values (fA and fG, respectively), and 
   the overall ranking score (f) being the average of fA and fG;
\item "performance", a list of 7 values summarizing the RFC ensemble 
   performances, including: 2x2 contingency table, sensitivity, 
   specificity, precision (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), 
   F1 score, and predictive accuracy.

\description{
RFC ensemble of 5 classifiers, based on 948 simulated 
   ultrasound profiles (440 malignant and 508 non-malignant). 
   The simulated dataset is divided into 5 random subsets and a nested 
   5-fold cross-validation (CV) is performed. For each CV cycle, 4/5 
   partitions are used as training set and the last one as validation 
   set. Each RFC is trained over 10000 bootstrap trees, with 3/14 
   randomly chosen variables per tree branching. Bootstrapping enables 
   independent prediction error estimation, using out-of-bag (OOB) 
   samples. OOB error estimation allows the claculation of mean decrease 
   accuracy (MDA) and mean decrease in Gini impurity (MDG). measuring 
   ultrasound feature-level contribution in RFC predictive accuracy and 
   classification entropy, respectively. These measures enable ultrasound 
   feature ranking, based on the average of minmax-normalized MDA and 
   MDG values (i.e., the most important feature scores 100, while the 
   least important tends to 0).
   Each CV cycle provides a dichotomous phenotype classification in 
   malignant (y = 1) and non-malignant (y = 0), OOB prediction error 
   estimation, and subject-level estimation of the prediction uncertainty 
   through Brier scores calculation. Given a new ultrasound profile, 
   the resulting 5 RFCs yield independent predictions and the majority 
   wins, whith higher priority to the RFCs with smaller OOB error.

# Create a simulated malignant ultrasound profile
x <- new.profile(simulate.us(y = 1))

# Lauch the Morhonode Predictive Model
